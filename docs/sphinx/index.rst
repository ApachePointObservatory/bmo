===============================
Welcome to BMO's documentation!
===============================

BMO provides a simple framework to control acquisition/guiding cameras on the focal plane of a telescope. BMO has been designed for `SDSS <http://www.sdss.org>`_ and to talk to our telescope control system, but it can be easily adapted for other projects.
